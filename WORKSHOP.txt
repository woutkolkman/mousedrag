[h3]Known issues/bugs[/h3]
- Pausing a deer while you're on it will make you slide off. You need to jump to be able to move again. 
- When cut/pasting Players, if there's a creature in their stomach (Hazer), it is often deleted. This happens because of limitations when deserializing a creature. 
- When cut/pasting objects, many objects will ignore the new position and spawn back on their old position in a new room. This is determined by how the object is programmed. 
- Cut/pasting Oracles (iterator puppets) has a VERY HIGH chance of crashing the game. Also, their sprites will not be removed immediately. 
- Pasting Garbage Worms in rooms where they cannot be might crash the game.
