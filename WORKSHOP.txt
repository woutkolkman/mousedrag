[h3]Known issues/bugs[/h3]
- Pausing a deer while you're on it will make you slide off. You need to jump to be able to move again. 
- Cut/pasting Players with creatures in their stomach (Hazer) can freeze the game, and won't restore the creature. 
- When cut/pasting objects, many objects will ignore the new position and spawn back on their old position in a new room. This is determined by how the object is programmed. 
- Cut/pasting Oracles (iterator puppets) has a VERY HIGH chance of crashing the game. Also, their sprites will not be removed immediately. 
- Cut/pasting creatures might not preserve their relationships (when warping). 
- Pasting Garbage Worms in rooms where they cannot be might crash the game.
