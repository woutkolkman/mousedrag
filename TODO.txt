Mouse Drag
- Add cooldown for radialmenu actions (and after opening/moving), like 5 ticks so you can't easily accidentally do an action twice?
- Constantly refresh/update radialmenu health tooltip, so changes in health are shown immediately?
- Add secondary menu which replaces the radial menu, and which looks more like a Windows context menu. Or use a Dev Tools dropdown (?) menu
- Add deadband tolerance thing to the mouse visibility initial movement change
- Check/fix the effect of RainWorldOnModsInitHook being called multiple times when certain mods are enabled (Rain Meadow)
- Rain Meadow multiplayer support? Configurable options for hosts to allow/disallow tools for other players?
- Change safari overseer selection when selecting a creature with Mouse Drag? Also pipe selection with mouse pointer in the same room
- Add option which can spawn a safari overseer with can be used to freecam in the current gamemode
- Info tool, add option which also opens a Dev Tools tab in-game with the same info or editable parameters? And scroll bars etc.
- Lock tool, add optional visual indicator when a bodychunk is locked? Or only if the mouse or radial menu selects this object
- Edit velocity drag so you can still drag bodychunks through walls
- Show more relationship info in label when hovering over radialmenu tame/clear relationships tools
- Configurable drag/radialmenu selection radius to select moving creatures more easily?
- Release KarmaFlower/Mushroom/etc. from terrain when dragged?
=== Forget list ===:
- Dev Console command md_select, add parameter for AND / OR / NOT / REPLACE options which have an effect on the already selected objects?
- Implement for fun: creatures reacting/looking at the cursor if it moves fast, or getting scared while being dragged, or throwing spears at the cursor
- Add keybind to swap between velocity drag and normal positional mouse dragging?
- Add multi-select crosshairs in different color when hovering over bodychunks? Or when bodychunks are about to be selected with the selection-rectangle?
- Add ctrl+z keybind to undo the last action? Mouse Drag code currently is not really structured to track actions well..
- Add alternative multi-select rectangle which is freeform and can be activated with left alt instead of left control (by default)
- If multi-select is active and objects are copied to the clipboard, when pasting these objects, paste the whole group at the same time (with original offsets?)?
- Double click select objects of the same type in the same room, with highlighting? To drag/execute actions
- Invincible creature tool? Probably uses too many hooks, and Dev Console already has this
- For every tool in the radial menu, add an preferred index which allows you to sort the tool within the radial menu. Implement before the code where tools are divided into pages
- Check if Pause list must become a weakreference list to avoid memory leaks? At every game end the list is emptied anyway, so no big deal
- Change Dev Console command 'md_safari_toggle' to 'md_safari' with new parameters? Might require relatively many safari code changes
- Add translations? Implement system to handle the translations
- Try to support Parasitic Slugcat safari controls & changes to creature movement when safari control tool is used https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972537492 
- Teleport players with SplitScreen Co-op if dragging them to another camera? Already possible with clipboard tool
- Divide every radial menu tool in sub-categories? Requires another menu overhaul
- Show like values of creature when hovering over tame/clear relationships? Probably too much data for the small FLabel above the menu
- Safari control, allow the camera to follow a slugpup when Jolly Co-op is enabled
- If MMB is used for opening the radial menu as well as selecting tools in the menu, implement another method of combinated close/open/selecting withing the menu? Can also be achieved with another option: open button will also close menu if clicked outside the menu. It might become hard to select the correct creature with this option enabled
- Try to set max width of labels in the remix options, so tooltips don't overlap over other components, or change order in which objects are added to the screen
- Add option which allows safari-controlled slugpups to perform backflips etc.? Maybe outside scope
- Option to use vanilla arena cursor instead of windows mouse pointer? Rain World cursor is part of the pause menu and arena overlay somehow, so probably not easy to implement in campaign. This option might also prevent the in-game cursor from being bugged https://www.reddit.com/r/rainworld/s/DWSN2xCoO7 
- Fix possible bug: when a slugpup is going into a pipe and you drag the pup away at the right moment, you might be able to break graphical update?
- Allow safari control tool to work if DLC is not enabled? Requires changes for every creature class, and maybe not allowed by the game devs
- Implement fix for Dev Tools V (player dragging) for SplitScreen Co-op? Maybe task for that mod to fix
- Add respawn icon with playernumber selection to respawn specific players? Might be possible with Dev Console already. Optionally configurable slugcat class?
- Loading bar graphic around the edge of the radial menu for options like delete in region, so you need to hold the mouse button for longer
- Add option where MMB can select within radial menu, and scroll can highlight tools?
- Change page icon in radial menu "+" to "1/3" etc.?
- In the radial menu, with the revive tool, when holding the mouse button and dragging, draw a new radial menu with a circular slider with which you can configure a specific amount of health
- Sharpener/Slugcat Eyebrow Raise zoom support? For offsets when dragging things
- Revive all friends in room tool, only players and tamed creatures
- Check if revive all in room tool also must revive players? This does happen currently
- Safari tool, try to implement creatures being able to activate gates and shelters. Hide the player somewhere to avoid exceptions and game crashes
- Ability to toggle gravity for specific objects/creatures. Track objects using CWTs? Gravity is implemented separately for every object, so this might require a lot of code changes and hooks.
- Option to disable fall damage when dragging players. Then disable velocity drag at screen change (enabled default).
- Dev Console integration, add radial menu tool to run last command or typed command on selected object or creature? Editing custom console commands might be pain
- Show health bar when hovering over a creature? Already implemented by Health Bars mod
- Change or duplicate Teleport tool code to support teleporting between rooms, maybe borrow clipboard code. Also handle loaded/unloaded rooms and regions
- Optionally pause graphical update when objects are paused
- Rewrite safari control code so the Update/loadCreatureRoom code is executed for every RoomCamera simultaneously (for SplitScreen Co-op)
- Try to var-edit offset positions for all objects correctly when they are cut/pasted (e.g. SeedCob). Try to support any object with the clipboard tool (Oracle, SeedCob, etc.)
- Try to implement time reversal, similar to The Cosmospectre mod, including a search bar
- Create snapshot of all creature states and positions in a room, and being able to return to this snapshot
- Rewind creature in time tool?
- Fix incompatibility with Rotund World when reviving obese slugcats? Likely just a funny mod interaction https://youtu.be/ss5ZYpGcXCU?si=Ju1OmJFi1YWY4bv9&t=1166 
- Improved safari gamemode controls: move screen when mouse is in corner, click on pipes to go to other rooms, click on creatures to select them with overseer, etc (check FreeCam mod)
- Add safari control icon to global/background radial menu, so you can switch cams between creatures using the radial menu? Might be confusing
- Add option for safari control tool to automatically switch to the next creature if a controlled creature dies
- Tool that makes objects chained to other objects within a configurable proximity, 'follow or avoid magnet'
- Keybind to add food pips to creatures/players (and mainly slugpups), also for Rotund World
- Safari control Oracle Puppets, maybe outside scope
- Controller support? (I don't own a controller)
- Add controller mode which can be activated with a button, that will both show a crosshair as drag objects? Crosshair will be aimed using the movement keys or a joystick, and the player will not move while the button is pressed.
- Add options which allows selecting within the radial menu using arrow keys and enter?
- Check if taming slugpups should also configure pup trust values (if these exist)
- Tame/untame features edit oracles? Like resetting reputation or meet counter.
- Save creature ID to text file with a star sprite, and spawn creature using a favorites list containing every saved creature in the text file
- Add option to drag players with or without maximum velocity with the velocity drag mode
- Add hold mouse button to repeat with all tools in the radial menu
- Add tool that will make all creatures in the room agro/target a specific creature. Might be available already using Dev Tools (destination position)?
- Biography mod support which allows copying ID in-game?

FreeCam
- Fix bug in arena mode / single screen rooms where roomcamera position is moved but screen isn't changed, lock campos in this case?
- Add visual feedback when a pipe to another room is selected and loading that room failed (red X on pipe tile)
- Add deadband tolerance thing to the mouse visibility initial movement change
- Add keybind for Warp Menu to freecam in specific rooms within the same region, or via Dev Console?
- Freecam with controller/joystick?
- Add possibility to move the freecam quickly to other pipes in a room, ctrl+arrow keys?
- Freecam temporarily follow another creature without controlling them, requires some code rewriting
- Freecam to another region via a pipe in a gate room? Maybe only if player is not loaded?
