Mouse Drag
- Implement actual API with static functions, which makes it easier to maintain internal functionality without breaking addon mods, one function for slots, one for submenus
- Add hold mouse button to repeat with all tools in the radial menu (instead of only duplicate keybind)
- Add deadband tolerance thing to the mouse visibility initial movement change
- Check/fix the effect of RainWorldOnModsInitHook being called multiple times when certain mods are enabled (Rain Meadow)
- Rain Meadow multiplayer support? Configurable options for hosts to allow/disallow tools for other players?
- Change safari overseer selection when selecting a creature with Mouse Drag? Also pipe selection with mouse pointer in the same room
- Add option which can spawn a safari overseer with can be used to freecam in the current gamemode
- Show more relationship info in label when hovering over radialmenu tame/clear relationships tools
- Add tools that can edit creature relationships like force a specific creature as prey for another creature
- Change info tool to also dump contents of structs, like creature personality
- Fix info tool stability in edge cases, also supporting obsolete properties
- Configurable drag/radialmenu selection radius to select moving creatures more easily?
- Also add safari-control camera change option to background radialmenu (instead of keybind only) | Add safari control icon to global/background radial menu, so you can switch cams between creatures using the radial menu? Might be confusing
- Add an unlock all bodychunks option and a clear forcefields option to the radialmenu
- Add an option that, when an object is paused, also pauses the graphics using an IL-hook | Optionally pause graphical update when objects are paused
- Add a button that drags all players in the room to the cursor (or the camera position?), just like Dev Tools?
- Option to enable just the player drag tool (V (& W?)) from Dev Tools?
- Change page icon in radial menu "+" to "1/3" etc.?
- In the radial menu, with the revive tool, when holding the mouse button and dragging, draw a new radial menu with a circular slider with which you can configure a specific amount of health
- Add a tool that can revive/respawn a specific player (by number), optionally make the slot visible only when an original player was deleted in a pit or similar ways
- Check if it's desired to block right mouse button opening radialmenu inside of the Dev Tools H menu? Already blocked with RegionKit integration enabled
=== Forget list ===:
- Add ctrl+a keybind which multi-selects every object in the room, depending on the selection settings for items/creatures
- Check if it is easier when a multi-selection is active and the menu is on the background, to make the menu show tools for the multi-selection instead of the background tools?
- Create new slots that can remove all applied forcefields or remove all bodychunk locks
- Create new remix menu options for the default visibility of lock and forcefield sprites on-screen
- Make clipboard cut/paste CTRL + C/V keybinds repeated, give visual indication of an action?
- Fix possible bug with actions on selected objects inside pipes, for example: multi select everything in the room, delete when one of the selected objects is in a pipe leading to the same room, the creature in the pipe won't be deleted (double check if this bug exists)
- Add option that locks (with the lock tool) a (multiple-?)selection in-place so the player feels more in control of multiple creatures, or player should pause/lock those manually
- Change velocity drag at screen change so there's a timer 2-3s that toggles back to positional drag when it expires?
- Add tool that toggles debug sprites for a single creature? If those sprites are still in the game and easy to toggle
- Make selection crosshairs color configurable? Entire radialmenu color configurable? Crosshair shaders configurable?
- Create and add a shader which inverts the color underneath it, for the selection crosshairs?
- Add secondary index option for Dev Console position in radialmenu on-background/on-object
- Add tool that can fill a room with water to a certain height, or remove all water?
- Dev Console command to bind a Dev Console command to a newly automatically generated menu slot (similar method like the group command), including retention after game restart? And a clear custom slot(s) command. Including functionallity that automatically enters the selector (or pass the reference) for a specific radialmenu-selected object.
- Try to fix BigSandGrub spawn issue where room is reloaded and its SandGrubBurrow is deleted and the SandGrub falls out of the room
- Translations, add 'unique' identifier "md_" at start of each translation to avoid issues with words having multiple translations/meanings in other languaages?
- Info tool, add option which also opens a Dev Tools tab in-game with the same info or editable parameters? And scroll bars etc. --> already implemented by Unity Explorer and addons
- Release KarmaFlower/Mushroom/etc. from terrain when dragged?
- Add secondary menu which replaces the radial menu, and which looks more like a Windows context menu. Or use a Dev Tools dropdown (?) menu
- Add cooldown for radialmenu actions (and after opening/moving), like 5 ticks so you can't easily accidentally do an action twice?
- Dev Console command md_select, add parameter for AND / OR / NOT / REPLACE options which have an effect on the already selected objects?
- Implement for fun: creatures reacting/looking at the cursor if it moves fast, or getting scared while being dragged, or throwing spears at the cursor
- Add ctrl+z keybind to undo the last action? Mouse Drag code currently is not really structured to track actions well..
- Add alternative multi-select rectangle which is freeform and can be activated with left alt instead of left control (by default)
- If multi-select is active and objects are copied to the clipboard, when pasting these objects, paste the whole group at the same time (with original offsets?)? Current clipboard list will become a list of lists
- Double click select objects of the same type in the same room, with highlighting? To drag/execute actions
- Invincible creature tool? Probably uses too many hooks, and Dev Console already has this
- Check if Pause list must become a weakreference list to avoid memory leaks? At every game end the list is emptied anyway, so not a big deal
- Change Dev Console command 'md_safari_toggle' to 'md_safari' with new parameters? Might require relatively many safari code changes
- Try to support Parasitic Slugcat safari controls & changes to creature movement when safari control tool is used https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972537492 
- Teleport players with SplitScreen Co-op if dragging them to another camera? Already possible with clipboard tool
- Optionally divide every radial menu tool in sub-categories?
- Show like values of creature when hovering over tame/clear relationships? Probably too much data for the small FLabel above the menu
- Safari control, allow the camera to follow a slugpup when Jolly Co-op is enabled
- If MMB is used for opening the radial menu as well as selecting tools in the menu, implement another method of combinated close/open/selecting withing the menu? Can also be achieved with another option: open button will also close menu if clicked outside the menu. It might become hard to select the correct creature with this option enabled
- Add option which allows safari-controlled slugpups to perform backflips etc.? Maybe outside scope
- Option to use vanilla arena cursor instead of windows mouse pointer? Rain World cursor is part of the pause menu and arena overlay somehow, so probably not easy to implement in campaign. This option might also prevent the in-game cursor from being bugged https://www.reddit.com/r/rainworld/s/DWSN2xCoO7 
- Fix possible bug: when a slugpup is going into a pipe and you drag the pup away at the right moment, you might be able to break graphical update?
- Allow safari control tool to work if DLC is not enabled? Requires changes for every creature class, and maybe not allowed by the game devs
- Implement fix for Dev Tools V (player dragging) for SplitScreen Co-op? Maybe task for that mod to fix
- Add respawn icon with playernumber selection to respawn specific players? Or only player 1? Might be possible with Dev Console already. Optionally configurable slugcat class?
- Loading bar graphic around the edge of the radial menu for options like delete in region, so you need to hold the mouse button for longer
- Add option where MMB can select within radial menu, and scroll can highlight tools?
- Sharpener/Slugcat Eyebrow Raise zoom support? For offsets when dragging things
- Revive all friends in room tool, only players and tamed creatures
- Check if revive all in room tool also must revive players? This does happen currently
- Safari tool, try to implement creatures being able to activate gates and shelters. Hide the player somewhere to avoid exceptions and game crashes
- Ability to toggle gravity for specific objects/creatures. Track objects using CWTs? Gravity is implemented separately for every object, so this might require a lot of code changes and hooks.
- Option to disable fall damage when dragging players. Then disable velocity drag at screen change (enabled default).
- Dev Console integration, add radial menu tool to run last command or typed command on selected object or creature? Editing custom console commands might be pain
- Show health bar when hovering over a creature? Already implemented by Health Bars mod
- Change or duplicate Teleport tool code to support teleporting between rooms, maybe borrow clipboard code. Also handle loaded/unloaded rooms and regions
- Rewrite safari control code so the Update/loadCreatureRoom code is executed for every RoomCamera simultaneously (for SplitScreen Co-op)
- Try to var-edit offset positions for all objects correctly when they are cut/pasted (e.g. SeedCob). Try to support any object with the clipboard tool (Oracle, SeedCob, etc.)
- Try to implement time reversal, similar to The Cosmospectre mod, including a search bar
- Create snapshot of all creature states and positions in a room, and being able to return to this snapshot
- Rewind creature in time tool?
- Fix incompatibility with Rotund World when reviving obese slugcats? Likely just a funny mod interaction https://youtu.be/ss5ZYpGcXCU?si=Ju1OmJFi1YWY4bv9&t=1166 
- Improved safari gamemode controls: move screen when mouse is in corner, click on pipes to go to other rooms, click on creatures to select them with overseer, etc (check FreeCam mod)
- Add option for safari control tool to automatically switch to the next creature if a controlled creature dies
- Tool that makes objects chained to other objects within a configurable proximity, 'follow or avoid magnet'
- Keybind to add food pips to creatures/players (and mainly slugpups), also for Rotund World
- Safari control Oracle Puppets, maybe outside scope
- Controller support? (I don't own a controller)
- Add controller mode which can be activated with a button, that will both show a crosshair as drag objects? Crosshair will be aimed using the movement keys or a joystick, and the player will not move while the button is pressed.
- Add options which allows selecting within the radial menu using arrow keys and enter?
- Check if taming slugpups should also configure pup trust values (if these exist)
- Tame/untame features edit oracles? Like resetting reputation or meet counter.
- Save creature ID to text file with a star sprite, and spawn creature using a favorites list containing every saved creature in the text file
- Add option to drag players with or without maximum velocity with the velocity drag mode
- Add tool that will make all creatures in the room agro/target a specific creature. Might be available already using Dev Tools (destination position)?
- Biography mod support which allows copying ID in-game?

FreeCam
- Update integration with Mouse Drag
- Fix bug in arena mode / single screen rooms where roomcamera position is moved but screen isn't changed, lock campos in this case?
- Add visual feedback when a pipe to another room is selected and loading that room failed (red X on pipe tile)
- Add deadband tolerance thing to the mouse visibility initial movement change
- Add keybind for Warp Menu to freecam in specific rooms within the same region, or via Dev Console?
- Freecam with controller/joystick?
- Add possibility to move the freecam quickly to other pipes in a room, ctrl+arrow keys?
- Freecam temporarily follow another creature without controlling them, requires some code rewriting
- Freecam to another region via a pipe in a gate room? Maybe only if player is not loaded?
- Add option that uses scroll wheel to zoom in/out
