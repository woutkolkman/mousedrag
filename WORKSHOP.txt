[h3]Description[/h3]
Tool which allows dragging creatures/objects outside sandbox-mode using your mouse, also known as the Sandbox Mouse. Includes options to pause, destroy, duplicate, tame, stun, teleport, cut/paste, safari-control, kill & revive individual creatures, players and objects. Also allows you to activate and throw items like bombs and spears. Press right mouse button on an object or the background to open one of two radial menus. Hold left control (default) to select multiple objects, or to use a selection-rectangle. While dragging use the scroll wheel to rotate objects.

[h3]Known issues/bugs[/h3]
- Pausing a deer while you're on it will make you slide off. You need to jump to be able to move again. 
- When cut/pasting a player in/to arena, if there's a creature in their stomach (Hazer), it is deleted. This happens because of limitations when deserializing a creature. 
- When cut/pasting objects, many objects will ignore the new position and spawn back on their old position in a new room. This is determined by how the object is programmed. 
- Cut/pasting Oracles (iterator puppets) has a VERY HIGH chance of crashing the game. Also, their sprites will not be removed immediately. 
- Pasting Garbage Worms in rooms where they cannot be might crash the game. 
- If Jolly Co-op is enabled in story-mode, you cannot safari-control slugpups or follow slugpups with the RoomCamera. 
- After returning from a safari-controlled creature and the player room was reloaded, you cannot open your map. Jolly Co-op will keep the player's room loaded and prevent this from happening.
